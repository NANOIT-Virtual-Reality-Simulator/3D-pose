## Introduction

This repository contains a multi-view optical motion capture system with support 3D visualizations. It includes a multi-camera calibration tool.

It is composed by the following modules:
- Capture module:
	- Sinchronized capture using Optitrack cameras (but can easily be extended to any type of camera by implementing the adequate interfaces).
- Calibration:
	- For intrinsics: charuco based calibration [1][2]
	- For extrinsics: charuco board pose estimation + nister 5-point algorithm [3]
	- Dynamic 3D visualization of calibration board
- Human pose estimation:
	- OpenPose 3D module with CERES optimization [4]

## Libraries

The following libraries were used:
- OpenCV 4.1.0 + Contrib Modules (aruco)
- OptiTrack Camera SDK 2.1.1
- OpenPose 1.5 (customized)
- VTK 8.2
- Boost 1.67
